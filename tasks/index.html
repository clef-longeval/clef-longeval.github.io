    <h3>Tasks</h3>

    <p>
        LongEval 2026 continues the Sci-Retrieval task from 2025 and introduces three new tasks: LongEval-TopEx
        (Topic Extraction), LongEval-USim (User Simulation), and LongEval-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
        Short descriptions, data sources and evaluation procedures for each task appear below. To receive

        <h4 class="task-card-title">Task 2.  LongEval-TopEx: Topic Extraction From Query Logs</h4>
        <div class="task-hint">
        <div class="task-section">
            <h5 class="task-section-title">Description</h5>
            <p>Offline evaluations of retrieval systems in the Cranfield Paradigm often formalize information needs into TREC-style topics that consist of a query (what searchers submit to the search engine), a description (what searchers actually mean), and a narrative (defining which documents are relevant or not).
               When queries are extracted from query logs, none of those formalization exists which can reduce the reliability of an derived offline evaluation collection (because the subjectivity of relevance judgments is increased).
               Task 2 of LongEval aims to extract TREC-style topics (query + description + narrative) from query logs to formalize the information need so that subsequent offline retrieval evaluaion corpora get more reliable relevance judgments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="task-section">
            <h5 class="task-section-title">Data</h5>
            <p>Training snapshot at time t; build a top-10 pool from Task-1 runs overlapping training queries and annotate with multiple LLM-based relevance assessors to obtain alternative qrels per topic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="task-section">
            <h5 class="task-section-title">Evaluation</h5>
            <p>We will create relevance judgments for the generated TREC-style topics with large language model relevance assessors and will verify how well the created relevance judgments are aligned over time with the future query logs (agreement with click-log qrels), how well they can distinguish retrieval systems submitted to Task-1 (ability to separate runs via nDCG) and clarity (how consist are the annotations across different large language models). We will measure the short- and long-term drops of those aspects. We also envision to feed the created topics to Task-3.</p>

        <div class="task-hint">
        <div class="task-section">
            <h5 class="task-section-title">Task Description</h5>
            <p>A central goal of the LongEval lab is to measure the performance of retrieval models over time. 
                Other models, like user models, were not in focus. Like retrieval models, user models are not 
                meant to be static and time-agnostic, although in practice, time and the evolution of retrieval 
                environments are often ignored. Therefore, in Task 3, we aim to evaluate user models in 
                longitudinal user simulations. </p>
            <p>The core assignment in Subtask 3 is <strong>next query prediction</strong>. 
                This task was previously introduced 
                in the <a href="https://sim4ia.org/sigir2025/#micro-shared-task">Sim4IA micro shared task</a>. 
                For LongEval, we focus on the longitudinal aspects of this user simulation task. The objective 
                is to accurately predict the final query of a given session (which the organizers will withhold), 
                based on the preceding interaction history and the best-fitting user simulator.</p>
            <p>For each provided session, participants must submit up to 5 candidate queries, ranked by their 
                likelihood of being the next query.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="task-section">
            <h5 class="task-section-title">Data & setup</h5>
            <p>Participants will receive the sessions containing the following rich set of features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The sequence of queries submitted.</li>
                <li>Timestamps for query submissions.</li>
                <li>The top-10 SERP (Search Engine Results Page) retrieved for each query.</li>
                <li>Which documents were clicked, along with their corresponding timestamps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The data will be provided in the following form:</p>
            <pre>
Index, User Name, Session Number, Query String, Timestamp of Query Submission, 
SERP, SearchID, "[('DocId', Time of Click, Type of Click)]"</pre>

            <p>For each implemented persona, submit a run file containing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>team_name</strong>: Can be freely chosen</li>

                    This can be a link to a repository, a prompt definition, or anything that helps 
                    explain your approach.</li>
                <li><strong>run_name</strong>: Should be meaningful and align with the naming used in

            <p>We will evaluate the query candidates based on semantic similarity to the original, withheld 
                query, and the redundancy among the candidates themselves. We will use the Rank-Diversity Score (RDS) 
                from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09329">Sim4IA-Bench suite</a>.
            <p>We will measure differences in RDS across snapshots. At the end, we would like to see which user 
                simulation or user modeling approach was most successful across the available snapshots. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="task-section">
            <h5 class="task-section-title">Starting Points, Framework, and Synergies</h5>
            <p>To ensure an easy start, we offer an adapted version of the SimIIR 3.0 Framework, including 
                sample simulators and video tutorials. However, the choice of framework remains entirely up 
                to the participants.</p>
            <p>For constructing the user simulator that performs the next-query prediction, we encourage 
                participants not only to effectively leverage all provided signals but also to integrate 
                supplementary or self-engineered features to enhance their simulator's predictive power. 
                Feel free to try out strategies like personas or specific user attributes (e.g., degree, 
                research field, or preferred interaction style). Different initial ideas can be drawn from 
                the <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/sim4ia_workshop_2025/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest">results of the Sim4IA Micro Shared Task 2025</a>.</p> 
            <p>We will not provide topic descriptions for the sessions or direct relevance judgments, 
                although inputs and overlaps from previous tasks are especially welcome. Participants 
                engaged in Subtask 2 ("Topic Generation") are strongly encouraged to leverage their approach. 
                This would allow them to build a comprehensive topic representation not only from a single 
                query but also from multiple queries within a session, and to use this insight to enhance 
                their query prediction simulator.</p>

        <h4 class="task-card-title">Task 4. LongEval-RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</h4>
        <div class="task-hint">
        <div class="task-section">
            <h5 class="task-section-title">Description & data</h5>
            <p>The Task 4 aims at studying to which extent does RAGs cope with  evolution of scientific knowledge in time.  Do to that, we provide the task participants a dataset composed  
            of two parts:<br>
            i) A textual query (along with its query id) for which the  participating system has to provide textual answer; <br>  
            ii) A set of document ids, mined from the corpus, on which the answer generation for particular query  must be solely  based (this set may be seen as a first stage filtering in a RAG system). This set of document is not expected to be composed  only of relevant documents to the query, but it also contains some relevant documents. The provided documents will be a part of the dataset provided within the Task 1. </p> 
            
            <p>The problem that has to be solved by the participants of this task is to provide (based on the query and the list of provided documents):<br>
            a) The generated answer using the extracts of documents in part b) below. <br>
            b) the document extracts that are relevant to the query (text extracted from the textual content of the documents provided in ii), using the contents from the LongEval 2026 corpus).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="task-section">
            <h5 class="task-section-title">Submission</h5>
            <p>For the submission of participants runs:<br>
            The responses for the part a) will be submitted as a string corresponding to the generated answer: (query_id, answer) <br>
            The responses for the part b) will be submitted as a set of pairs (maximum 5): <br>   
            (query_id, {document extract}) : where a document extract is a character string considered to be relevant by the participant for the query. As several extracts may be defined, a run will contain a set of extracts.<br> 
            The examples of an exact submission format and 3 training queries (based on the 2025 dataset) will be provided by the end of February.</p>  
            <p>Overall, each submitted run is a zip file composed of  three text files, one for the a) for all queries, one for b) for all queries, and one file "description.txt" that shortly describes the submitted system. The name of the zip file will be used as the run name during the evaluation process.<br>  
            A maximum of 3 runs may be submitted by each participating team.</p>
            <p>Example of task 4 query (based on the 2025 dataset):<br>  
            - Query_id: 00005<br>
            - Query: "What operation dominates the cost of homomorphic AES evaluation, and how can hardware architectures reduce its impact?" <br>
            - Docs_id: {7964767, 66637364, 42856664, 31316619, 19943691, 19531678,156069243, 156069094, 150704088, 141753453} <br>
            </p>
            <p>The result for this query:<br>
            - Part a: (query_id: 00005, answer: "Large-degree polynomial multiplication dominates the cost of homomorphic AES evaluation. Hardware architectures reduce its impact by decomposing coefficients using CRT, performing fast NTT-based multiplications in parallel, and minimizing modular conversion overhead through optimized arithmetic pipelines.")  <br>
            - Part b: (query_id: 00005, extracts: {"Polynomial multiplication dominates AES evaluation cost."", "Hardware mitigation via CRT + NTT +  optimized modular arithmetic."})
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="task-section">
            <h5 class="task-section-title">Evaluation</h5>
            <p> The evaluation of a) will be done using classical text generation evaluation measure, such as ROUGE or BERTscore. The evaluation of b) will be done using the computation of the overlap (e.g. Lenvenshtein distance) between the manually assessed  relevant extracts and the retrieved parts.  </p>
